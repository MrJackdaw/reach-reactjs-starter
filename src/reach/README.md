  A lightweight redux-like global state manager. You can create additional instances (e.g. to separate global UI state values from Reach values), or build out the `ReachStore` instance (by adding properties to it) if you want to use that as your single application state. View the [library API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jackcom/raphsducks#reference) to learn how to use it.
